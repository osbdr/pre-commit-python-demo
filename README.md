# Pre-Commit Demo for Python Source code

The file can be used as "gist" or to demonstrate the use of pre-commit hooks within development, prio to the github/gitlap pipelines application.

Content:

* trailing-whitespace - This hook trims trailing whitespace. 
* check format of yaml, json, and xml
* check-symlinks are correct
* check-case-conflict in declarations, and imports
* check-docstrings are not forgotten as a note of the developer for himself
* check-merge-conflict are resolved before Github/lab is bothered
* end-of-file-fixer required if work happens on Windows, Linux, Unix (BSD Mac OSX) operating systems
* trailing-whitespace
* fix the format of json and pretty-format-json
* check in develop, and master branches that the imports are "pyupgrade(d)"
* add-trailing-comma, when missing
* make imports nicer, and reorder-python-imports
* get your source code opinionated organised, and understandable (with black)
